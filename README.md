# Password Manager

## Description

The **primary function** of this application is to securely **store and manage user passwords**. Users will be able to *add*, *retrieve*, *change*, and *delete* passwords. The application will include a *search* feature to quickly locate stored passwords and an option to *generate* random, strong passwords. By offering a centralized and secure location for password management, the "Password Manager" will make it easier and more efficient for users to handle multiple passwords.

This application is **designed for** people who needs to *manage numerous passwords securely*. This project is of **great interest** to me because in my daily life, I find managing numerous passwords is time-consuming and difficult for me. Developing this application will allow me to deepen my understanding of Java programming, while creating a tool that provides real value by helping users manage thier passwords.

## Instructions for Grader
- You can generate the first required action related to the user story "adding multiple Xs to a Y" by clicking the button labelled **"Add Password"**.
- You can find passwords by clicking the button labelled **"Find Password"**.
  Because "find" is an ambiguous action, you can simply enter parts of the item name to receive a list of items.
- You can view passwords by clicking the button labelled **"View List"**.
- You can delete passwords by clicking the button labelled **"Delete Password"**. Because "delete" is a serious action, you need to enter full item name
  and username to do this.
- You can generate passwords by clicking the button labelled **"Generate Password"**.
- You can locate my **visual component** by *background*, and also when you click the button labelled *"Add Password"*.
- You can **save the state** of my application by click "Yes" buttons when you try to quit. You could have pop-up windows that give the user the option (using Yes/No buttons) to save data.  
- You can **reload the state** of my application by click "Yes" buttons when you start. You could have pop-up windows that give the user the option (using Yes/No buttons) to load data.
