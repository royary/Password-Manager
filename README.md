# Password Manager

## Description

The **primary function** of this application is to securely **store and manage user passwords**. Users will be able to *add*, *retrieve*, *change*, and *delete* passwords. The application will include a *search* feature to quickly locate stored passwords and an option to *generate* random, strong passwords. By offering a centralized and secure location for password management, the "Password Manager" will make it easier and more efficient for users to handle multiple passwords.

This application is **designed for** people who needs to *manage numerous passwords securely*. This project is of **great interest** to me because in my daily life, I find managing numerous passwords is time-consuming and difficult for me. Developing this application will allow me to deepen my understanding of Java programming, while creating a tool that provides real value by helping users manage thier passwords.
